        1. INTRODUCTION:
        The introduction of the Advanced Communication Skills Lab is considered essential at 3rd year level. At
        this stage, the students need to prepare themselves for their careers which may require them to listen
        to, read, speak and write in English both for their professional and interpersonal communication in the
        globalized context.
        The proposed course should be a laboratory course to enable students to use ‘good’ English and
        perform the following:
         Gathering ideas and information to organize ideas relevantly and coherently.
         Engaging in debates.
         Participating in group discussions.
         Facing interviews.
         Writing project/research reports/technical reports.
         Making oral presentations.
         Writing formal letters.
         Transferring information from non-verbal to verbal texts and vice-versa.
         Taking part in social and professional communication.
        2. OBJECTIVES:
        This Lab focuses on using multi-media instruction for language development to meet the following
        targets:
        1. To improve the students’ fluency in English, through a well-developed vocabulary and enable
        them to listen to English spoken at normal conversational speed by educated English speakers
        and respond appropriately in different socio-cultural and professional contexts.
        2. Further, they would be required to communicate their ideas relevantly and coherently in writing.
        3. To prepare all the students for their placements.
        3. SYLLABUS:
        The following course content to conduct the activities is prescribed for the Advanced English
        Communication Skills (AECS) Lab:
        1. Activities on Fundamentals of Inter-personal Communication and Building Vocabulary -
        Starting a conversation – responding appropriately and relevantly – using the right body language
